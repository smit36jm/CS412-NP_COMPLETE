We are doing min-graph coloring where the goal is to color each vertex on a graph. However each vertex must not have a connected edge with the same color and
we have to find the minimum number of colors needed to satisfy this requirement.

Our graph is undirected and the input will be the number of vertices on the first line followed by a line for each vertex and all of its connected edges.
The output will simply be the minimum number of colors needed for the given graph.

Sample input:
3
1 2 3
2 3
3 1
Sample output:
3
